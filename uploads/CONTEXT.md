# Streamly — Context for Chat Continuations

> **Read this first in every new chat.** Your job is to pick up exactly where the last chat left off —
> as if you're the same AI with full project memory. Read everything. Then answer or ask.

---

## 🔄 HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. Read the whole thing before responding
2. Check **"Active work"** — what was in progress when this chat ended
3. Check **"Open questions"** — things not yet decided
4. Check **"User preferences"** — how this user works, what they reject
5. If the active work has a plan in **"Pending plans"**, follow it
6. If an open question is blocking you, ask the user before doing anything
7. If context is insufficient to answer, say "I need more info on X before proceeding"

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

**Streamly Hardened** = Flask web app acting as a local Seedr client with integrated torrent search.

**User journey:**
1. Login with Seedr account (or close dialog → Guest mode for search-only)
2. **Search tab**: type a title → bitsearch.eu results → click **Add** → torrent sent to Seedr cloud
3. **Cloud Drive tab**: browse Seedr files, stream video, download/zip, delete
4. **History modal**: view/copy/re-add/delete magnet links (global, device-wide, stored in Upstash Redis)

**Deployment:** Docker on Render (free tier) + UptimeRobot every 5 min to prevent sleep.
**Persistence:** Upstash Redis (HTTP REST, no TCP) stores: SECRET_KEY, refresh tokens, magnet history.
**Sessions:** In-process TTLStore (not Redis) — Seedr client objects per session ID.

## USER PREFERENCES (CRITICAL)

This user works in a specific way. **Follow these always:**

1. **Describe intent → I plan → User approves → I implement**
   - They describe what they want
   - I break it into steps BEFORE writing any code
   - They ask questions or approve the plan
   - Only then do I implement
   - I update workspace files only — no code in the chat

2. **Never assume — ask questions** when requirements are ambiguous or missing info that would affect correctness.

3. **TXT files that are actually zip archives** — extract to workspace first, don't try to read as text.

4. **CSS load order is sacred** — `base.css` before `responsive.css`. Never change.

5. **Never hand-edit `app.js`** — it's generated from `src/` fragments. Edit fragments → run check.py.

6. **Don't re-litigate decided things** — the CHANGELOG documents decisions that are done. Check CHANGELOG first.

7. **Summarized answers only** — not verbose explanations unless asked.

8. **Only perform actions that won't time out the chat.**

## ACTIVE WORK

> Fill this in at the end of every chat. Describes what was being done and what's pending.

### Last session ended with these results:

**What was being worked on:** Architecture refactor (Blueprints + Service split) and final stability hardening of the Cloud and Search APIs.

**Status:** Completed and Verified.
- `services.py` $\rightarrow$ `cloud_service.py` + `search_service.py`.
- `app.py` routes $\rightarrow$ `routes/` blueprints.
- All 500 errors resolved via `_get_cfg` polyfill in `security.py`.
- Strict storage enforcement implemented in `/api/add`.
- Deployment scripts updated for portable Python support.

**Pending fixes:**
1. Logout endpoint (still pending - not critical for current use case).
2. Broad exception cleanup: 1 remaining in `app.py` (global handler), which is intentional.

**Conclusion:** The app is now in a highly stable, maintainable state and is fully deployable.

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

1. **Refresh token = full Token (not just refresh)** — stored as base64. seedrcc's `from_refresh_token()` crashes if the response omits a new refresh token. Storing the full token sidesteps that bug.

2. **Silent re-login** — On 401 from non-login endpoints, JS calls `/api/login/silent` (8s debounce). `init()` uses double-try: `/api/status` first → silent relogin fallback → forces Guest mode. Login popup can be dismissed (continue as guest) via × or Escape.

3. **Bitsearch DNS fallback via DoH** — scoped monkey-patch to `socket.getaddrinfo` via context manager + lock. Only active during the request. Cached 5 min. Only used after normal DNS fails.

4. **Upstash for persistence only** — TTLStore is in-process. RedisStore wraps Upstash HTTP API. Used for: SECRET_KEY, refresh token, magnet history. NOT for session storage.

5. **Asset cache-busting** — `asset_ver` computed as max mtime of all static files in `index()`. Template injects `?v={{ asset_ver }}`.

6. **URL hash routing** — `setTab()` writes `window.history.replaceState(null, null, #${name})`. Refreshing restores the correct tab.

7. **History is global** — Redis key `streamly:history:global_history`. Deduplicated by magnet. Capped at 50.

8. **Video player with StreamlyPlayer deep link** — `openItem()` detects video extensions (mp4, webm, mov, m4v, mkv, avi). Inline player + "External Player" button uses `streamlyplayer://play?url=...`.

9. **Paste → auto-detect magnet** — `pasteBtn` reads clipboard, fills input, and if it detects a magnet link, automatically calls `search()` which saves to history and adds to Seedr.

10. **Defensive attribute access** — ALL service attribute reads use `getattr(obj, attr, default)`. Never crashes on missing attributes.

11. **Suggest debounce** — 350ms wait + race guard: skips results if user kept typing and input no longer matches.

---

## MOBILE-SPECIFIC DECISIONS (don't regress)

- **Cloud Drive**: Seedr-style list. Tap=select, double-tap=open, ⋮ kebab=Download/Copy Link/Delete. Multi-select with bulk action bar above storage meter.
- **Search**: Desktop table kept, scaled to fit. Columns: NAME · SE · TIME · SIZE · ADD. Category + Leecher columns removed. Add button is icon-only via `font-size:0` + `::before` glyph (data-state: +/…/✓).
- **Search box**: Paste (📋) and Clear (✕) are in-field. Clear keeps results on screen.
- **Bug fixed**: `background-attachment: fixed` + `backdrop-filter` caused mobile blank/hang — removed.
- **Breakpoints**: ≤980px (tablet), ≤700px (mobile cloud/search changes), ≤420px (compact pagination).

---

## KNOWN TECH DEBT

1. **Duplicate `init()`** — both `1-core.js` and `6-main.js` define `init()`. Last one in bundle order wins. `6-main.js` runs last so its `init()` is active. Needs cleanup.

2. **`updateSelected()` mentioned in CHANGELOG as removed** — still in `2-cloud.js`. Verify if dead code.

3. **No frontend framework** — single IIFE closure with no module isolation. Fragment naming is the only namespacing.

4. **In-process session store** — users logged out on multi-worker Render deploys.

5. **Bitsearch rate limits** — shared IP on free tier. Cloudflare Worker proxy recommended (DEPLOY.md step 5).

6. **`deploy.bat` force-pushes** — `--force` on git push. Hardcoded WinPython path. Auto-tags with `good-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`. Rollback via `rollback.bat` uses git tags.

7. **`/api/suggest` has no CSRF** — read-only, rate-limited. Intentionally unauthenticated.

## OPTIMIZED WORKFLOW (use this)

### Files at a glance
```
QUICK.md       ← 1-page reference (read first, every chat)
CHANGES.md     ← template + examples for changes.json
changes.json   ← current session's changes (edit this to deploy)
deploy_all.py  ← run this: writes files + rebuilds + verifies + docs + zip
check.py       ← smoke tests: JS brackets + CSS braces + Flask boots
deploy.bat     ← commit + push → Render auto-deploys
ACTIVITY_LOG.md ← deployment history
```

### How to make changes (3 steps)

**Step 1 — You:** Describe the changes fully in chat.

**Step 2 — Me:**
1. Read `QUICK.md` (1 page, instant)
2. Read the relevant code end-to-end
3. Write `changes.json` with the updated file contents
4. Run `python3 deploy/deploy_all.py`
5. Check.py runs automatically → all verified
6. Docs auto-updated (CHANGELOG, CONTEXT, ACTIVITY_LOG)
7. `project.zip` created

**Step 3 — You:**
1. Double-click `deploy/deploy.bat` → commit + push
2. Test on Render
3. Report bugs with exact error messages

### Git snapshot (safety net)
`deploy_all.py` auto-commits a `before-{timestamp}` git tag before applying changes. To revert:
```bash
git reset --hard before-20260531-143022
```

### Writing changes.json
See `CHANGES.md` for full template. Basic format:
```json
{
  "session": "YYYY-MM-DD — what changed",
  "changes": [{"file": "path", "content": "..."}]
}
```

### Checklist before writing changes
- [ ] Read current file from workspace
- [ ] Trace full data path (caller → callee)
- [ ] Check CHANGELOG for related decisions
- [ ] Handle null/empty/max edge cases
- [ ] CSS load order unchanged
- [ ] Never edit app.js directly
- [ ] Note judgment calls in comments

---

## WORKFLOW FOR MAKING CHANGES (legacy reference)

The optimized workflow above replaces this. kept for reference:
- Edit src/ fragments → check.py → deploy.bat (old manual way)
- New way: write changes.json → deploy_all.py (automated)

---

## CHANGELOG SOURCE NOTES

The original `CHANGELOG.md` (in workspace root) contains additional handoff details. Key things from it not captured above:

- **Abandoned/dead features removed from codebase:** Bridge badges CSS, magnet-paste CSS, Webtor branch, unused `updateSelected()` function. Do NOT re-add these.
- **`updateSelected()` is dead code** — NOT the same as `updateSelection()` which IS used. Do not confuse them.
- **`build_zip.sh`** — referenced in CHANGELOG as a script that rebuilds `/home/user/project.zip`. Not present in current workspace. May have been a local utility.
- **`check.py`** — CHANGELOG says "run before committing" at repo root. The actual working copy is `deploy/check.py`. Do not look for it at the root.
- **Windows deploy tooling** — uses portable WinPython 3.12.4 at a hardcoded path. Change `PYEXE=` in deploy/*.bat files to move Python.
- **Loop:** User edits src/ fragments → double-click `deploy/deploy.bat` → done.

---

## USER'S WORKING RULES (from RULES.md)

The user sets these. Always follow them:

1. **User describes what they want.** You do not ask for clarification unless critical.
2. **You break it into steps before writing code — no code yet.**
3. **User asks follow-up questions or approves the plan.**
4. **You provide before/after comparison** so only the requested modifications are made.
5. **Summarized answers only** — not verbose explanations unless asked.
6. **Code in the background, not in the conversation** — update workspace files only.
7. **Workspace contains a `project.zip`** that auto-updates when any file changes.
8. **Only perform actions that won't time out the chat.**
9. **When user uploads a `.txt` that is actually an archive (Arena.ai workaround), extract it into the workspace first.**
10. **Never assume — ask questions** when requirements are ambiguous or missing info that would affect correctness.

---

## USER'S USE CASE (personal context — not shared publicly)

**What this app is used for:** Pirating movies via Seedr — convenience layer over Seedr.
- User has been using Seedr for 7 years
- Pain point: too many steps to add torrents to Seedr
- Custom video player that plays files directly (Seedr doesn't allow this)
- History as a permanent wishlist — survives accidental Seedr deletion
- Shared Seedr account — anyone with the link has access, no credentials for end users

**Previous chat's topic:** Making changes quickly and accurately without requiring debugging.

---

## GLOBAL LOGIN ARCHITECTURE

**Status:** Already implemented. Shared Seedr account via `SEEDR_EMAIL` + `SEEDR_PASSWORD` env vars + Redis token persistence.

**Key flows:**
1. Manual login → token stored in Redis (survives server restarts)
2. Auto-login on server restart → env vars used as fallback
3. Seedr password change → login form pops up (fail-safe)
4. No logout endpoint (not needed for single-user/shared-account use)
5. 3-4 concurrent users handled fine

---

## PENDING FIXES (from login audit)

These were decided and are waiting to be implemented:

1. **Storage check before add** — before `/api/add` fires, query storage via `/fs/folder/0/items`. Block if torrent size > available space. Prevents wasting storage on files that won't fit.

2. **Empty token guard** — `serialize_token()` can return `""` silently. Add validation to reject empty strings from being stored in Redis.

3. **Logout endpoint** — clears Redis token + TTLStore + session. Not critical for use case but keeps things clean.

4. **Redis health check on startup** — if Upstash is unreachable on boot, log a clear warning so the user knows before errors cascade.

5. **Fix broad `except Exception`** handlers — 13 places catch all exceptions. Replace with specific exception types.

6. **Fix error messages** — `str(exc)` and `str(e)` leak internal details to users. Use generic messages.

---

## USER PREFERENCES FOR WORK

- **Plan first, code later** — describe what you want, I break it into steps, you approve, then I implement
- **Summarized answers only** — not verbose
- **No debugging sessions** — changes should be accurate enough to not need debugging. If something might not work, I say so before writing code
- **Workspace files only** — no code in the chat
- **Will return to this** — user will come back to implement the 6 pending fixes listed above
